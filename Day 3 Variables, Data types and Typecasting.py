#varibles are containers to hold the values and store it in memory at particular address.
#Python is dynamic language so we don't need to define the variable with data types.

var="Puru !"  #defining a variable and assigning value to it.
print(var) #assecing and printing the variable

#String values are written within  " "

#when we add two string variables, it get concatenated.
#When we add two integer variables it gives its sum.

var1="Hello "  #String
var2="85 "    #string
var3="65"

var4=98
var5=23

print(var1 + var)
print(var2 + var3)  #it will concatenate
print(var4 + var5) #it will give sum

#Datatypes----->
#we can know the datatype of any variable by:
print(type(var1)) #string
print(type(var4)) #integer



#Typecasting ------>
#changing an datatype of variable is called typecasting
print(int(var2)+int(var3)) #string value is changed to integer and prints its sum
